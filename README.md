# Ylm
My spherical harmonics calculator using the C++ STL(Requires C++20)<br>
You will have to use your own tasks.json depending on your needs.<br>

The function is: 
```cpp
std::complex<double> Ylm(unsigned n, unsigned m, double theta, double phi)
```
This computes the spherical harmonic of the given two angles theta, phi of order n, and degree m.
